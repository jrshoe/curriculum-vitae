# Xue, Xu's CV

## You made it yourself?
No, it's based on [markdown-cv](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv/)

## Why not MS Word?
Heavy and user-unfriendly on macOS.

## Why not (La)Tex?
I'm too lazy to compile.

## Why not Overleaf templates?
It can't be version controlled.

## Why jekyll?
Markdown is easy, and html/pdf automatic generation is cool.

## Why Github Pages?
I'm too lazy to deal with servers.

## Why only one page instead of including it into blog?
Well.. I have no habit of writing blogs, and I have to maintain it printable. So less page, less dirty work.

## Any disadvantages?
* It has not been adapted for mobile view.
* Font varies on differnt platforms.
* MMYYYY sometimes overlaps with paragraphs.
